 Soft computing methods are problem-solving strategies that have been
 used to obtain approximate solutions to complex problems. Biologically
 inspired methods such as Artificial Neural Networks, Evolutionary Algorithms,
 and Fuzzy Logic are a few examples of soft computing methods, which are also 
 collectively referred to as Computational Intelligence. These methods are usually
 inspired by the strategies that nature uses to solve problems. Most frequently, 
 they are employed to substitute or enhance complex and computationally intensive
 mathematical models that have proved intractable for conventional analysis based 
 on hard-computing strategies.

In recent years, an increasing role of soft computing in several
engineering fields has been observed, leading to many exciting and
innovative applications. This mini-symposium aims at bringing together
scientists and engineers working in different areas of soft computing.
The mini-symposium covers all aspects of soft computing applications, 
with a special focus on those in structural and earthquake engineering. 
Possible contributions include but are not limited to the following methods
and techniques:
